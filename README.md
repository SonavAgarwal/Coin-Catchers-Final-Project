# Coin Catchers Final Project
A game created for my Advanced CS final game project.

How to run: 
* download the contents of the repository
* open the folder in terminal / command prompt
* run `javac *.java && java Runner`

How to play:
* use the arrow keys to move
* collect coins
* avoid purple enemies and red spikes
* lead purple enemies into red spikes to kill them

The requirements for the project:
* use hashmaps to store the tiles
* have a character that can collect objects
* have different types of obstacles
* have enemies that run using multithreading
* have obstacles that reset the player's location

My project:
* I made the world three dimensional in order to give the game more depth
* the game took some amount of inspiration from other voxel games
